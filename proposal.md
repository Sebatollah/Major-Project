# Major Project Proposal

I am going to make a platformer game loosely based on the magic system in a book called mistborn.

## Must Have list

- Movement, jumping, gravity etc.
- Colision with walls and death blocks(spikes or lava)
- The ability to push and pull your self from/to the metal blocks
- level editor
- tutorial levels and normal levels
- music and sound effects

## Nice to have list

- enemies
- the ability to change the resolution
- combat system
- story
- more powers
- different worlds (world 1-1 would be level 1 world 2-1 would be the second world but still first level)
- dialogue
