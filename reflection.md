# Reflection

## Advice to self if I fo a project like this again

I should spend more time on the project and ask for help from others outside the class

## Hardest Part of Project

making colision work in the grid based world and presumably making the lines work in the grid world

## Did I Complete the Needs to Have List

I completed everything on my needs to have list except for the music, putting death blocks in, putting the steel pushing in the main project instead of the interactive scene,
and making a win condition

## What am I most proud of

the pushing and pulling mechanic, I think is super cool and was done well with the time I had

## Little quality of life things

In my level editor if you put the spawn point or end point down you cant place anymore but if you place anything over it you can place it again even if you place the end point
on the spawn point or vice versa.

## How will this help me in the future

In the future I think I will try my hand at trying to make a really good mistborn game again and this has helped me learn what to do and what I need
